            <p class="text">Mind is a product of the relation of the brain and the ontological designing what is external to it
                One example of this is a change in the nature of reading (how to) functional reading is increasing, while to learn, cultivate the mind and gain is pleasure decreases. This change marks a more general move from 'a deep to shallow engagement,' linked to transition from general literary cultural environment to a media consumptive one of instant entertainment â€” a situation being seen not just a reducing memory but intellectually damaging to the ability to think and write beyond instrumental needs. It also increases a dependence on means of tertiary  retention (devices of artificial memory),  which effective produces a 'poverty of mind' from a reduction of mental analytic and reasoning skills while diminishing the  condition of imagination the informed facility to image with, and experiential encounters in the world which prompt the imagined. It follows that
                artificial means that think for us (AI) reduces this developmental process. Tech-corporate myopic productivist instrumentalism appears blind to the ontological designing of mind of the products they produce variously described as 'brain rot', 'digital dementia', and 'the diminishment of cognitive 
                abilities'. What is underway is a condition of intellectual slippage in which AI thinks for increasingly many of us. This is in effect a trend that can lead to the power of mind slipping into technological control (singularity). The power of AI and its links to quantum computing can engender a feeling of 
                ignorance, and an already recognised danger of control (and the designation of 'our' redundancy). The speed of the technology is not only alarming, but equally so is that this speed is going to increase. 'We' may well be between a world of human and technological dominance. Notwithstanding the global inequity of the distribution of the digital technosphere, the impacts on us are going to be huge. There is already recognition of the economic displacement of  vast numbers of industrial and administrative workers (already named as 'the useless class' ). Some of the creators of AI have even warned of it destroying 'us'.
