                In Tension has an independent institutionally unaligned position. Its perspectives will be critical, intercultural and committed to advancing views and actions that resist the defuturing and neo-reactionary forces, politics and cultures that have become such a feature of the global present. Its forms of address will aim to be accessible without shying away from engaging and presenting issues from either practical or theoretical points of view. We editors will invite contributions and submission on diverse current topics. Our material will be bilingual, and visual content will be integral to our approach to communication. We will question, argue, provoke and enter into dialogue with readers.
                In Tension is not just a website and pdf publication, it is also a project and a platform under construction. The intention of In Tension is to grow the project as readership grows in size and in active engagement. Podcasts will come soon, events a little later. Projects will emerge out of circumstances, needs, and created relationships.  Its aim is to expose challenging ideas and issues, explore and develop contrapractices, prompt and host dialogue. It will appear biannually. Our contributors will be diverse and global.
