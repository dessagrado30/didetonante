                War has lost its clarity. Asymmetrical warfare blurred its edge, and the distinction between the soldier and the civilian. While unrestrictive warfare dissolved the boundary between war and politics, economy, industry, information and psychology. As a result, any divide between war and peace has gone: nations are at war with nations with whom they appear to be at peace the USA and China being a not completely obvious example. Conflict is an even more ungrounded term—from a family feud to an international incident it needs to be situationally contextualised. Resistance is the most amorphous of all. Its meaning sweeps across politics, physics (empirically verifiable) , behaviour (observable), to a particular form of asymmetrical war-fighting conduct (harassment and sabotage by irregular forces). Politically it can be read as organised opposition to undercover forms of subversion, organised minor and major protests by organisations, groups and individuals by direct or indirect means from direct action to campaigns of opposition to information and psychological warfare interventions. Such resistance is vulnerable to symbolic gesturalism (action without agency) and appropriation not least by capital of youth subcultures. 
                The challenge of the present is that as multiple crises deepen enviro-climatical, geopolitically, economically, and as ever more people get impacted, displaced and abandoned, the trend of political regimes to become more authoritarian will increase. So, while these trends will increase, so will the need to resist, but the freedom to do so will diminish. Thus, two imperatives arrive: to improve and develop existing modes of political resistance; and to innovate and create new ones.

                Street protest is a longstanding, common and familiar form of resistance. It sits between two extremes: in Margret Thatcher's Britain in the late 1970s early 1980s it was cast and blunted by her as evidence of a functioning democracy, at the other extreme in fully repressive regimes, like Russia street, such protest prompts mass arrest and imprisonment. With sufficient numbers such action can have political agency as a statement of opposition. But if generative of violence, property damage and looting it can also be counter-productive. Likewise, such protests can be exploited by the state to demonstrate its power, especially when this involves a direct  confrontation with paramilitary police or the military. The traditional mode of organisation has been to get as many people onto the street as possible marching with placards and banners in the hope of media coverage. In an age of greater complexity of issues, and communications technology, together better  equipped and trained law enforcement, the need for better organised and resilient forms of mass protest invite consideration. There are lessons to learn and actions to take.
                One of the control tactics is to 'cut the head' of the lead group of protestors and 'snatch' its leaders—this to produce disorder, fragment and reduce efficacy. A counter-measure (learnt from Asia) is to link bodies (not just arms) to form a block. In the past this was done by a wide front row gripping a long, thick wooden pole, this can equally be done with a rope. In addition, the lead block needs training to mirror that of law enforcement. The point here is not to enable violence but to blunt it. The other major action is to take charge of the narrative. The protest should have its own photo and recording documentation team  with pre-recorded and live material feeding the media from an off-location pop-up expo and media venue. 
                There are historical  lessons to learn. One example comes from the women protesting in the UK against nuclear armed aircraft operating from RAF/USAF Greenham Common, home of 96 nuclear warheads. In 1983, over 30,000 women linked hands, completely surrounding the nine-mile perimeter fence of the Airforce base. They set up a camp there which was supported by women from all over the country maintaining a presence in rotation, which they did for 19 years. It ended because in 2000 the airbase was decommissioned. It created a culture of feminist resistance. It was non-violent, but was not passive. For example, porridge was thrown at the windscreen of police cars who were taking arrested women away (which they frequently did). The result was the driver turned on the wipers and this smirred  porridge over the windscreen, was hard to get off, and made the cars undrivable. above all it demonstrated commitment and endurance.
                Confrontation with paramilitary and military forces equipped with tear-gas grenades, flash-bangs, rubber-bullet guns, and live-ammunition firing small arms is a dangerous challenge. Again.  it invited contingency planning and implementation, plus innovation rather than spontaneous reaction. Deployed opposition to protest usually takes two forms: the defence of property, or the clearing of a mass of bodies from a space. It has to have a 'command and control system.' and its actions are predicated upon expected patterns of behaviour. The responsiveness to this is speed, movement and group reconfigurations, and unpredictability. Confuse rather than confront.
