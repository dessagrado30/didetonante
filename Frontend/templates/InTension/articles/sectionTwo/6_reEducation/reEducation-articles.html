                Education-in-error: the developmental form and content of the education system globally is structured toward tertiary education entrance (according to UNESCO this represents 40% of all  people aged 18-24). The majority therefore can be argued to have been disadvantaged by this bias. <br><br>
	            Even more fundamental, the underpinning of education is based upon divisions of knowledge created during the European Enlightenment. These divisions directly link to professional practices and of education become dominantly instrumental and in the service of the economy. This modality of knowledge is at odds with the functional relational interconnectedness of Earth system and their ecologies. As a result, the way people learn to materially create, occupy and replicate the worlds of their existence as unsustainable as it negates the conditions that sustain life.<br><br> 
                To become futural the foundation of education needs to become so that people think and act relationally across all of their practices. While such a challenge is huge and daunting it is not a choice. Unless a process of adaptive change is made over coming decades our species, and many others, will not survive. This imperative adds to the state of tension everyone feels, as such it has to be a major issue of this publicationâ€™s agenda.
